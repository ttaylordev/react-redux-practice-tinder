# Redux Notes

- redux is a state container
- it is a collection of all the data that the app uses.

- react controls the views.

- Centralize all the apps data into a single object
  - that object is called 'state'
  - application level state is what is refered to in redux,m rather than component level
  


- a reducer5 is a function that returns a piece of the application state

- because the app can have many different pieces of state, we can have many diffferent reducers

- a container is a react componenet that has a direct connection 6to the state of redux.

- Containers are often called 'smart components' as opposed to 'dumb components'

- a dumb component has no direct connection to redux.
